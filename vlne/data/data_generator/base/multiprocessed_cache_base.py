    """A decorator around DataGenerator to precompute batches in parallel.

    This decorator around DataGenerator will spawn multiple concurrent
    processes to generate batches from the decorated object on the first use.
    The precomputed batches will be stored in the RAM cache.

    This may eat all your RAM since each parallel process will get a copy of
    the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dgen : DataGenerator
        DataGenerator that creates batches to be precomputed and cached.
    workers : int
        Number of parallel processes to use.
