    Since joining data in batches is very computationally expensive process
    this decorator caches results in RAM, which allows to significantly improve
    performance when the same data batch is reused multiple times (like during
    the training phase). You should have a good amount of RAM though.

    ----------
    dgen : DataGenerator
        DataGenerator that creates batches to be cached.
