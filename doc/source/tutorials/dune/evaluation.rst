Evaluation of Trained Networks
==============================

`vlne` package comes with a number of scripts to quickly evaluate
performance of the trained neural networks. You can find a short introduction
on how to use such scripts in the NOvA tutorial
:ref:`tutorials/nova/evaluation:Evaluation of Trained Networks`.

The only difference from the NOvA's case is that you should use DUNE evaluation
presets, e.g. ``dune_numu_5GeV``.
